- 1.0.4
	- Instead of interpotating meshContainer position and rotation, the mod now interpolates Target position and rotation of the meshContainer. This results in much more natural movement.
	- Spider looks at the end point of the offMeshLinks when traveling through them for the time being.
- 1.0.3
	- Reverted back to Lerp interpolation
	- Agent now teleports to the nearest navMesh point when the spider crawls off walls.
	- Slightly loosened the tollerance
	- removed static from variables. Spiders no longer affect eachother.
